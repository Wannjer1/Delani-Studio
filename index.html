          When you work with us, you are part of a team of committed
          collaborators. All aspects of our software development process are
          intergrated, interactive and agile.<br />Our approach unifies design,
          development and product management to create exceptional products.<br />We
          start each project by understanding your business goals, the user's
          needs and the product requirements <br />Then we help translate them
          into effective and elegant solutions.

        <p>
          Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend
          the necessary time needed to understand your product vision.<br />The
          outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement
          of work.<br />
          Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just
          the pieces you need.
